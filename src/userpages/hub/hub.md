## A GUIDANCE DOCUMENT ON ACCELERATING ELECTRIC MOBILITY IN INDIA
###### - Written for Shakti Sustainable Energy Foundation by IIT Madras (CBEEV) & WRI India

Electric mobility is grabbing attention globally. Leveraging this wave will bring multiple environmental and economic gains for India. These include improved air quality, reduced dependence on imported fuel, reduced emission of greenhouse gases (GHG), improved plant load factor for the electricity grid, and the opportunity to be a leader within a rapidly growing global market. While policy guidelines that prescribe a quantified electrification target by a certain date for India are yet to be set, the many policies that have been adopted thus far demonstrate a clear intent of growing the share of electric vehicles in the country.
